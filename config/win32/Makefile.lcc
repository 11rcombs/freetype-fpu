#*
#*  The purpose of this sub-Makefile is to define various build and
#*  platform specific variables before including the sub-Makefile
#*  containing the FreeType library rules, found in
#*
#*     $(TOP)/config/freetype.mk
#*
#*  The following variables must be defined before including this
#*  file :
#*
#*     TOP          Pathname to the top of the FreeType sources
#*                  hierarchy
#*
#*  This file should define the following variables before including
#*  the FreeType library rules file :
#*
#*     BUILD        Pathname to the platform-specific files used
#*                  for the build. Usually `$(TOP)/config/<system>'
#*
#*     SEP          Directory separator used during compilation.
#*                  (usually "/" or "\"). Note that on Win32, both gcc
#*                  and Visual C++ use "/" as a directory separator !!
#*
#*     HOSTSEP      Directory separator for $(COPY) and $(DELETE)
#*
#*     DELETE       The forced remove/delete command to erase one or more
#*                  files
#*
#*     INCLUDE      The location of all public header files. e.g.
#*                  `$(TOP)/include'include'                                      *
#*                                                                          
#*     SRC          The directory containing all sources. e.g.              
#*                  '$(TOP)/src'                                           
#*                                                                           
#*     OBJ_DIR      The location where compiled object files will be         
#*                  placed, e.g. '$(TOP)/obj'                              
#*                                                                           
#*     LIB_DIR      The location where the resulting library file will be    
#*                  placed, e.g. '$(TOP)/obj'                        
#*                                                                           
#*     LIBRARY      The filename of the resulting library file, without      
#*                  its extension.. e.g. 'libfreetype' or 'freetype'         
#*                                                                           
#*     O            The object file suffix.  Can be '.o', '.obj,' '.lo,'     
#*                  ';coff,' etc.                                            
#*                                                                           
#*     A            The library file suffix.  Can be '.a' '.so,' '.lib'      
#*                  '.dll,' etc.                                             
#*                                                                           
#*     I            The path inclusion flag.  Some compilers use a           
#*                  different flag than '-I' to specify an additional        
#*                  include path.  Examples are '/i=' or '-J ', etc.         
#*                                                                           
#*     D            The macro definition flag.  I haven't met compilers      
#*                  which don't use the '-D' switch to define a macro, but   
#*                  who knows...                                             
#*                                                                           
#*     T            The compilation flag used to identify the target. Some   
#*                  compilers use a different flag than '-o ' to specify     
#*                  the name of the target object file.                      
#*                                                                           
#*     CFLAGS       The set of flags used to compile object files.
#*                  (usually contains the flag '-c').
#*
